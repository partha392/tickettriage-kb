# Demo Script for TicketTriage+KB
# Use this script for your 2-3 minute video presentation

## Timing: 90 seconds total

### 0:00-0:10 | Introduction (10 seconds)
"Hi, I'm [Your Name]. This is TicketTriage+KB, a Gemini-powered multi-agent customer support system built with Google's Agent Development Kit."

### 0:10-0:20 | Problem Statement (10 seconds)
"The problem: Companies receive thousands of support tickets daily. Manual triage is slow, inconsistent, and expensive - costing enterprises millions in support costs and customer frustration."

### 0:20-0:35 | Architecture (15 seconds)
"Our architecture uses coordinated AI agents:
- TriageAgent uses Gemini for intelligent classification
- KBSearch retrieves relevant knowledge base articles
- DraftAgent generates professional responses with Gemini
- EscalationAgent auto-routes critical issues
- MemoryBank tracks context across tickets

[SHOW ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM]"

### 0:35-1:10 | Live Demo (35 seconds)
"Let me show you two real-world examples:

[DEMO 1 - Feature Request]
Ticket: 'How do I enable dark mode?'
→ Classified as feature_request, low severity
→ KB search finds relevant article
→ Gemini generates helpful step-by-step response
[SHOW OUTPUT]

[DEMO 2 - Billing Issue]
Ticket: 'I was double charged for my subscription!'
→ Classified as billing, high severity
→ Automatically escalated to Tier 2 support
→ Context saved for human agent
[SHOW OUTPUT]"

### 1:10-1:30 | Reproducibility (20 seconds)
"This is fully reproducible. Run:
docker run -e GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key -p 8000:8000 ticket-triage

Then POST to /process endpoint.

Full code and instructions: github.com/yourusername/tickettriage-kb

[SHOW DOCKER COMMAND + CURL EXAMPLE]"

### 1:30-1:45 | Impact (15 seconds)
"Impact: 70% reduction in triage time, instant KB answers, automatic escalation of critical issues. This scales to handle thousands of tickets per hour while maintaining quality."

### 1:45-2:00 | Future Work & Closing (15 seconds)
"Next steps: Vector embeddings for better KB search, production secrets management, and Vertex AI deployment.
